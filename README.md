A backpropagation nueral network with different loss functions
Data format: A csv file with last columns at target
Currently, only single cost function is supported (simple difference between target and predicted values), so network only works for regression problems

Running this project:

cd ./classfiles

java BackPropagationNetwork -classpath .
